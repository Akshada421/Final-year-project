<div>The rapidly developing technologies have influenced education greatly. Especially the
pandemic locking us inside our homes, everything from education to employment has
gone digital. From traditional classrooms to digital classrooms, everything has evolved.
Along with this, various instructional websites and courses on the weeb have grown
dramatically. Web-based courses that consist of the syllabus, assignments and lecture
notes are now widely used.</div>
<br> <br>
<div>Data structures prove to be an effective way of performing various operations related to
data management including storing and arranging data along with its retrieval so that the
data can be easily used and manipulated in the future as the need arises.Data Structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts. But it has been observed that
many students find it difficult to remember the various algorithms in data structures since
abstract thinking is required in order to comprehend it and grasp the concept. A technique
for improving instruction in this critical area is to include algorithm and data structure
visualizations and animations. It would be very helpful if there was a visualization tool of
data structures such as arrays, queues, stacks, trees and graphs for students to experiment
with. The tool would allow students to see how an element is inserted into or deleted
from different data structures, how a tree is traversed in different order (pre-order,
in-order, post-order, level-order), etc.They illustrate data structures in natural, abstract ways instead of focusing
on memory addresses and function calls.</div><br><br>
<div>The main objective of this visualization platform is to provide a way for learning
the concepts in a more effective as well as enjoyable way which will engage the learners
and drive away any boredom.</div><br><br>
<div>The purpose is to build a user friendly interface where the students can experiment and
learn data structures. The main aim is to mitigate the gap between studentsâ€™ theoretical and practical ability
related to data structures via this platform to provide a systematic approach for learning
and conceptualizing implementation of data structures.</div><br><br>
<div>We are presenting a data structure visualization tool designed to animate standards
manipulations of several common data structures. The platform is intended for use by
students wanting to practice with algorithms being covered in class, as well as instructors
wishing to enhance their lectures with an animated interface.</div><br><br>
<div>Thus, our objective is to explain and teach the concepts of data structure to anyone who is eager to learn.</div>
